FG-Field Goals (includes both 2-point field goals and 3-point field goals)	
FGA-Field Goal Attempts (includes both 2-point field goal attempts and 3-point field goal attempts)

2P- 2-Point Field Goals

2P%- 2-Point Field Goal Percentage; the formula is 2P / 2PA.
	
eFG%	-Effective Field Goal Percentage; the formula is (FG + 0.5 * 3P) / FGA. This statistic adjusts for the fact that a 3-point field goal is worth one more point than a 2-point field goal. For example, suppose Player A goes 4 for 10 with 2 threes, while Player B goes 5 for 10 with 0 threes. Each player would have 10 points from field goals, and thus would have the same effective field goal percentage (50%).

ORB- Offensive Rebounds
